## 1. License Tiers and Pricing

The use of this library ("the Software") is governed by the following licensing tiers:

| **Tier**                              | **Price (USD)**         | **Users Covered**       | **Support**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[Free](modern-jdk-license-1.0.md)** | \$0                     | Latest JDK version only | None                                                                                          |
| **Starter**                           | \$999/org/year          | Up to 5 users           | Email only                                                                                    |
| **Team**                              | \$2,500/org/year        | 6-15 users              | Email, Private support channel, up to 2 hours of onboarding                                   |

Organizations with more than 10 total employees must purchase at least the Starter tier, even if only a
single user is using the Software. Organizations are responsible for selecting the appropriate tier based on
team size and use case. Misrepresentation of license tier or usage constitutes a material breach of this
agreement.

## 2. License Scope and User Definition

A **user** is any individual who writes, compiles, tests, debugs, or maintains source code that directly or
indirectly integrates with the Software, whether directly, via wrappers, code generators, or any form
of abstraction.

No license is required for individuals who **only deploy, operate, or use** software that includes the
Software, without modifying or maintaining code that integrates with it.

This license **does not grant** rights to white-label, rebrand, or redistribute the Software unless explicitly
authorized via an **Enterprise license**.

A **subsidiary** means any entity controlled by your organization via >50% ownership or equivalent voting
rights.

---

## 3. License Grant

Subject to payment, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to:

* Use and integrate the Software across licensed users;
* Compile and run the Software on supported Java Development Kit (JDK) versions, including older versions
  (e.g., JDK 8 or 11);
* Use the Software in private or commercial projects, within the limitations of your license tier.

You must obtain a paid license if:

* You require support for **JDKs other than the latest GA (Generally Available) version**;
* Your organization exceeds **10 employees**;
* You need private support, redistribution rights, onboarding, or legal review.

---

## 4. Support and Onboarding

Support is available only during an active license term and is governed by tier:

| **Tier**       | **Support Details**                                                                                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Free**       | No support                                                                                                      |
| **Starter**    | Email only (response time not guaranteed)                                                                       |
| **Team**       | Private support channel, including **up to 2 hours** onboarding during the first 30 days                        |

Additional consulting or development assistance is available through separate agreements.

## 5. Restrictions

You **may not**:

* Remove, alter, or obscure copyright, license, or attribution;
* Rebrand or white-label the Software without written approval;
* Use wrappers, proxies, or code generators to **mask actual usage** or circumvent user-based licensing;
* Redistribute modified or original versions of the Software without an Enterprise license;
* Use the Software outside the scope of your tier, user count, or license term.

These restrictions ensure fair usage and protect the sustainability of the Software for all customers.

Any attempt to bypass these restrictions, whether through legal, technical, or contractual trickery,
constitutes a **material breach** of this agreement.
---

## 6. Redistribution of Modified Versions

You may distribute modified versions of the Software **only if**:

* All license notices are retained, and usage restrictions continue to apply downstream;
* Modifications do not remove or alter attribution to the Software;
* The redistributed version does **not** circumvent licensing requirements;
* You ensure downstream users do not violate per-user licensing terms as defined in Section 2.

You **must not** redistribute the Software in ways that enable unlicensed or unauthorized use.

---

## 7. Compliance and Audit

Once per calendar year, **9187219 Canada Inc.** may request a written statement from your organization
attesting to:

* The number of users, as defined in Section 2, who have used the Software in the prior 12 months;
* Your adherence to all license terms.

You agree to provide this statement **within 30 days** of such a request. This ensures transparency and
compliance, without requiring invasive audits.

---

## 8. Termination

Your license may be terminated if:

* You breach any material term of this agreement;
* You exceed your tier or user count without upgrade;
* You fail to pay or renew license fees in a timely manner.

Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy any copies within your control.

Except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, **9187219 Canada Inc.'s total liability** under
this agreement shall be **limited to the amount paid by you in the prior 12 months**, or **\$1,000**,
whichever is greater.
