# Support Policy

1. Support Scope  
   Support includes assistance with bug fixes, installation, configuration, and usage of the Software as
   delivered **to licensed users**.

   A **licensed user** is any individual who writes, compiles, tests, debugs, or maintains source code that
   directly or indirectly integrates with this library (see [Commercial License](commercial-license-1.0.md)
   Section 2). Individuals who only deploy, operate, or use software that includes this library (without
   modifying or maintaining its integrations) are **not** eligible for support unless otherwise covered by the
   license holder.

   Support includes:

- Troubleshooting errors and defects.
- Providing updates, patches, and maintenance releases.
- Guidance on proper usage.

Support **does NOT include**:

- Implementation of new features or enhancements.
- Custom development, consulting, or training services.
- Assistance related to white-labeling or rebranding the Software.

1. Support Eligibility  
   Support is available to commercial license holders for the duration of their active license period. Users
   under the ModernJDK License are not eligible for support.

2. Support Period  
   Support is provided for one (1) year from the date your commercial license fees were last paid in full.
   Continued support requires timely renewal of license fees.

3. Support Channels  
   Support requests should be submitted via [email](mailto:cowwoc2020@gmail.com)
   or [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/anchor4j/shared_invite/zt-3826d8qfp-ebXGQNDGozVtyxo_Ibuu7w).

4. SLA Timing  
   All support SLAs (e.g. 24-hour or 48-hour response times) are measured in **business days**, defined as
   Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern Time, excluding public holidays. SLA clocks pause outside
   of these hours.

5. License and Support Termination  
   Failure to comply with license terms or payment obligations may result in termination of support and
   license rights.
