  <artifactId>canister</artifactId>
  <version>0.10</version>
</dependency>
```

## Example

```java
import io.github.cowwoc.canister.core.id.ImageId;

import io.github.cowwoc.canister.docker.api.client.DockerClient;

import java.io.IOException;

class Example
{
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException
	{
		try (DockerClient docker = Docker.fromPath())
		{
			ImageId id = docker.buildImage().
