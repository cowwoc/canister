/**
 * A virtualization image.
 *
 * <h2>Terminology</h2>
 * An image's <b>reference</b> is an identifier having the format
 * {@code [HOST[:PORT]/][NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY[:TAG|@DIGEST]}.
 * <p>
 * Where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code HOST} refers to the registry host where the image resides. If omitted, the image is
 *   assumed to reside on Docker Hub ({@code docker.io})</li>
 *   <li>{@code PORT} refers to the registry port number. If omitted, the default port number (443 for
 *   HTTPS, 80 for HTTP) is used.</li>
 *   <li>{@code NAMESPACE} typically refers to the user or organization that published the image. If omitted,
 *   it defaults to {@code library}, reserved for Docker Official Images.</li>
 *   <li>{@code REPOSITORY} is the name that groups related images, typically representing a specific
 *   application, service, or component within the given namespace in the registry.</li>
 *   <li>{@code TAG} is the version or variant of the image.</li>
 *   <li>{@code DIGEST} is a SHA256 hash of the image's content that uniquely and immutably identifies it.
 *   The digest ensures content integrity - even if tags change or move, the digest always points to the
 *   exact image.</li>
 *   <li>An image reference includes either a tag or a digest, but not both. If both the tag and digest are
 *   omitted, a default tag of {@code latest} is used.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An image's <b>ID</b> is an automatically assigned identifier that is unique per host and may be equal to
 * the image digest.
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety</b>: Implementations must be immutable and thread-safe.
